    /*
    key word is : must be inheritad !!
    abstraction involves the facility to define objects that represent abstract “actors” that can perform work,
    report on and change their state, and “communicate” with other objects in the system.

     In simplest words,
     you can define abstraction as which captures only those details about a Java object that are relevant to the
      current perspective.

      Types of abstraction !!

  1. Data abstraction;
  Data abstraction is the way to create complex data types and exposing only meaningful operations to interact with the data type,
  whereas hiding all the implementation details from outside works.
  The benefit of this approach involves capability of improving the implementation over time
  e.g. solving performance issues is any. The idea is that such changes are not supposed to have any impact on
  client code since they involve no difference in the abstract behavior.

   2. Control abstraction;
  A software is essentially a collection of numerous statements written in any programming language. Most of the times, statement are similar
  and repeated over places multiple times.

  Control abstraction is the process of identifying all such statements and expose them as a unit of work.
  We normally use this feature when we create a function to perform any work.

    /*

    Abstraction simply means separating responsibilities between different modules.
    1.Is one which make a class abstract in object orient programming. It means it provides only essential features for a certain program when needed.
    2. Abstract class cannot be instantiated.
    3.Abstract methods will be declared in parent class.
    4.If a class has abstract method .Its class should also been declared as abstract.
